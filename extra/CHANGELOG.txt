ELSE (EL Locus Solus's externals) with Live Electronics Tutorial

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 45

LIBRARY:

Breaking changes:
- [sr~] removed functionality to set sample rate because it doesn't work any more in Pd 0.52 (will try to figure out how t bring this back).
- [output~] object removed. I always hated it! Now Vanilla has one with the same name as of Pd 0.52, which also bad, but nothing justifies keeping this here now...
- [canvas.wname] object removed, this functionality is now incorporated into [canvas.name].
- [ctl.in] added a new mid inlet for control number.
- [clock] renamed to [midi.clock] / [clock] is now a new object

Enhancements/fixes:
- [note]: support for italic variants of DejaVu Sans Mono thanks to Pd 0.52.
- [sample~]: added support for .caf sound file thanks to Pd 0.52.
- [display]: improved efficiency in canvas label handling thanks to improvements in GUI labels in Pd 0.52.
- [else]: fixed minimum Pd version checking.
- [loadbanger]/[lb]: now reacts to 'loadbang' message sent to subpatch/abstraction.
- [sequencer]: fixed bug getting the right index.
- [pattern] added a '-i' flag to output index;
- [player~]: fixed sample rate compensation on 'open' message.
- [message] can now expand dollar signs via inlet;
- [median~] fixed it blowing up Pd;
- [bin.shift~] fixed "divide by 0" warning;
- [ctl.out] added arg to set control #;
- [canvas.name] added -w and -env flag;
- 4 new objects for a total of 434: [metronome], [clock], [tap] and [midi.learn]. 

TUTORIAL:
- small fixes/improvements; a mentioning of the new [midi.learn]/[tap] objects; and new examples for [metronome] and [clock]. Total number of examples is now 450.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 44

Import/export to txt files; new clear message; fixed dump message; fix stop message when in 'clock' mode.
- [nmess] fixed initialization, this fixes many abstractions ([samps2ms], [gran.player~], [pvoc.player~] and probably much more).
- [keyboard]: new 'set' message and a new (considered better) color scheme.
- [op] fixed "<<" and ">>" and symbol input to set the operator
- [gain~]/[gain2~], fixed loading args correctly
- minor fixes in [group] and [circle]
- [tabplayer~]: fix arg loading.

- [presets]: fixed asking to save, addd click functionality to open edit window.
- 2 new objects for a total of 433: [rec] and [store].

TUTORIAL:
- Revised 19-Sequencing, added an example for [presets], added new examples to reflect new features and objects ([midi] / [rec] / [store]).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 43

LIBRARY:

Breaking changes:
- envelope~: phase argument removed, use a flag now
- range~: reset method replaced by a bang message
- rad2hz~ and hz2rad~ have been removed... it was just too stupid... others like that might go too...

Enhancements/fixes:
- [envelope~] added 3 new envelope types: vsaw (variable saw), gauss (gaussian) and trap (trapezoid).
- [grain.synth~]/[grain.sampler~]/[grain.live~], added more envelope options (hann, tri and gaussian).
- [midi2freq] can now convert lists.
- [pattern] fixed crash.
- [morph] added exponential factor to morph.
- [presets] added exponential factor to morph too besides interpolation.
- [op]/[op~] added '%' (fmod) operator
- [drive~] added a 3rd new mode
- [glide~]/[glide2~] fixed a bug when updating the target before reaching the last target
- 8 new objects for a total of 431: [gaussian~], [pimpmul~], [freq2midi], [deg2rad], [rad2deg], [pz2coeff], [coeff2pz] and [zbiplot]

TUTORIAL:
- added examples for [freq2midi], [gaussian~] oscillator and gaussian envelope.
- revised 14-Triggers-LFO-LFNoise section, added more examples with more objects, including the new [pimpmul~] object.
- added an example for [impseq~] in 19-Sequencing.
- Filters-II section Revised/Rewrritten, fixed some bugs/translations, added a new section about Moving Average Filters, added new examples and now we're using new objects from the ELSE library [pz2coeff], [coeff2pz] and [zbiplot].
- Total number of examples is now 440!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 42

LIBRARY:

Breaking changes:
- [sequencer]: bar outlet now gives bar number instead of 'bang' - (and default now is 'empty', where nothing comes out!)

Enhancements/fixes:
- [unmerge] fixed output for mixed (float/symbol) input.
- [break] now can break with symbols more than character that matches the argument.
- [presets] fixed a bug where it didn't handle messages with a single '|' (as needed for [else/sequencer]).
- [sequencer]: fixed float input not take into account barlines as elements in the sequence. Fixed dealing with actual symbols that start with "-" (by not considering a symbol separator). Added 'clear' method - plus other fixes.
- [sample~]: fixed 'load' message.
- 1 new object for a total of 425: [pattern]. 

TUTORIAL:
- revised '01-Pd.Quickstart/2.syntax'

- New part Part.02-Basic-Processing came to be as a division from Part 1. New chapter just for fade.in/fade.out, new examples for [autofde~]/autofade2~] objects and new examples that reflect the new [slew~]/[slew2~] objects from ELSE beta 40.
