Alexandre Torres Porres (me) is behind it as the producer and teacher. I started organizing events with PdCon09 (the 3rd International Pure Data Convention in 2009, SÃ£o Paulo - Brasil), I've also been teaching computer music courses since then.

EL Locus Solus offers a computer music tutorial with examples in Pure Data for its courses. These are in portuguese as of yet, with plans for english translation and formatting into a book. There are over 350 examples for now and they were designed to work with Pd Extended 0.42-5, making extensive use of the existing objects available in Pd Extended's libraries.

Even though extended has quite a large set of external libraries and objects, at some point there was the need of something "else". Thus, EL Locus Solus is now not only offering computer music examples, but also the "else" library, with extra objects for my didactic material.

There are no releases available yet
